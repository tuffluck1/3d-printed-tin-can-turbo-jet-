Hey-new-person!


First a disclaimer: I am not a professional!
I do not have a professional engineering background nor do I have a degree in it. 
I do not suggest you build this yourself. This repos purpose is for me to have something to show off to colleges if it doesnt kill me. So,
just to reiterate, dont build this, if you decide to build this you are not only risking your wellbeing on non-professional design
but also my ability to remeber to record every single part of the process in here. I am not perfect and I may forget a crucial 
saftey feature in my writeup. If you disregard all of this and you do it anyways; I am not responsible for what happens.  

With that out of the way, the code.

Now, if you wanna know how the code works:
READ THE CODE!!! 
I spent so much time commenting this with descriptions of what everything does so im not gonna go into detail here.
But just a quick explanation is : it checks all of its systems, verifys you are ready, gives you a countdown to make sure, then it starts the airflow and then the fuel and then waits a set delay to prevent a hard-launch, then it fires and starts to record data and check its deadswitches. 

Now my favorite part, the engineering:

First we'll talk about the fuel/ignition system and how I assembled it: 
I am using what I have, so for the fuel delivery/ignition I made some modifications to a propane torch.
