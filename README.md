#Hey-new-person!


First a disclaimer: I am not a professional!
I do not have a professional engineering background nor do I have a degree in it. 
I do not suggest you build this yourself. This repos purpose is for me to have something to show off if it doesnt kill me. So,
just to reiterate, dont build this, if you decide to build this you are not only risking your wellbeing on non-professional design
but also my ability to remeber to record every single part of the process in here. I am not perfect and I may forget a crucial 
saftey feature in my writeup. If you disregard all of this and you do it anyways; I am not responsible for what happens.  

Now, if you wanna know how the code works:

READ THE CODE!!! 

I spent so much time commenting this with descriptions of what everything does so im not gonna go into detail here. 

With that out of the way, some non 3d printed items I used.

- a propane torch head

- 

The fuel system and how I assembled it: I am using what I have, so for the fuel deliery/ spark I made some modifications
to a propane torch.
